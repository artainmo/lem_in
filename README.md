A program in c that takes an ant-farm description consisting of a start room, end room, rooms in between and tunnels between those rooms.<br>
The ants need to move from start to end room in the shortest time possible, knowing in-between rooms can only contain one ant at a time.<br>
We need to use graph-traversal-algorithms for this. I will implement the “depth-first search” algorithm, adapted to this project of course.
